<p><h2>WEB</h2></p>
<p>
The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, was originally a hypertext document management system accessed over the Internet. It has since evolved into the world's dominant software platform.
</p>
<p>
The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
